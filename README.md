#  Trackvestment Backend

### Overview

Trackvestment is a backend system that helps users track their **TFSA**, **RRSP**, and **RESP** investments.
It makes sure users **don’t go over their contribution limits** each year.

The backend is built with **Go (Golang)** using the **Gin** web framework and uses **SQLite** for storing data.
